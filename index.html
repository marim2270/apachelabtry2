  <p> There are a lot of ways that you can type code in HTML. Your going to want to start with a title, which is what people will see on the tab. This command is pretty straightforward, you just type title><em>your title</em> and then add the ending, which
    is /title>, with an arrow in front of the title. I can't actually show it in text becasue then it records as a command and doesn't show at all.
  </p>
  <p> Your gonna want to do the body next. It's exactly like title except the whole site will go in between the starter body and the ending body. A quick tip: <strong>NEVER FORGET THE SLASH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE END.</strong> Otherwise things can get really
    screwed up really fast.
    <p> Next up is the pharagraph command, which is literally just p (with of course the arrows and the slash for the end p) This command makes a gap between text.
      <p>Next are headings.Headings are good for search engines. h1 is most important, and so on and so forth. Like keywords. When people search for certain words on Google, then the headings are what Google uses to put 2 and 2 together. The tag is just
        h1, h2, h3, etc.
      </p>
      <p>HTML doesn't really have a lot of text editing. There are two beginner ones, emphasised and strong. This is what <em>emphasised looks like</em><strong> and that is what strong looks like.</strong> The tag for emphasised is em and the tag for strong
        is strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two types of HTML elements, container and stand-alone.
        <br/>The two beginner stand-alone's are br/ and img/.
        <br/>br/ makes a space and img/ is an image. br/ and In order to have an image though, you need to have a value. Values must be contained inside quotation marks and are the value of a given attribuite. An example when using a value is when you have
        an image. An image looks like this <img src="https://www.google.com/doodle4google/images/splashes/featured.png" </p>
        <p>The code looks like img src="<em>image URL</em>"/> with an arrow in front of img. Image can also use width and height.
        </p>
        <p>The new image looks like <img src="https://www.google.com/doodle4google/images/splashes/featured.png" alt="https://www.google.com/doodle4google/images/splashes/featured.png" height="350" width="400" </p>
          <p> Before I had no control over the height and width of the image, but now I do. The code reads like img="image URL" alt="image URL" height="#" width="#"> with the arrow before img of course.Usually though, it's just easier to adjuist one.
          </p>
          <p> A link also uses values. A link has three components, the tag, the href attribute and the title attribute. the tag is an a. A link is like <a href="https://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> was actually a lot of work. When the target tag
            is added, it pops the link in a new tab. This is with the target tag.<a href="https://images.google.com/" target="blank">Google Images</a>. The first link takes you to Google Images with the tab you have open whilst the second one pops Google
            Images in a newtab.
            <p/>
            <p>Sometimes images can be links and images at the same time
              <a href="https://images.google.com" target "blank">
                <img src="http://72gpf1za5iq428ekh3r7qjc1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image86.jpg" alt="Google Images" width="500" border="0" />
              </a>
              <br/>When you right click the imge, an open link in new tab will come up, whilst with the other images, the list only comes up with thing image specific.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes when your code is getting really long (like mine right now), you have to add comments to let other devlopers know what your doing. A site like mine which clearly states what I'm doing usually wouldn't need comments, but that's not
              always the case. A comment in code loks like this !---comment here --->, with an arrow before the exclamation mark. A comment doesn't really do anything except tell other people who are gonna be coding in the site what exactly you did.
            </p>
            <p> Another thing that you can do in HTML is make a table. A table looks like this.
              <table border="3" cellpadding="3">
                <tr>
                  <th>C1</th>
                  <th>C2</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Data</td>
                  <td>Data</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              Since it's rather complicated to code for a table, I'll just instert an image of the code.
            </p>
            <p><img src="http://breezi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/table-with-css.jpg" width="500" /> </p>
            <p>There are two things that you could add that aren't required.They are border and cellpadding. Border gives the table a border and cellpadding makes the cells of the table bigger. Both are farily straightforward. Border is border and Cellpadding
              is cellpadding. You will have to add numbers, but usually anything under 10 is good.
            </p>
            <p> That is pretty much everything that I have to teach on HTML. I yoy have any further questions, then Google has everything. I'll even link <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl" target="blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/"
              target="blank">Bing</a> right here. <a href="htmlandcssbook.com" target="blank">Here</a> is a more comprehensive list of HTML elements A link to my site on CSS can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/marim12082000/full/aOQWoE/" target="blank">here.</a>              Thanks for reading.
